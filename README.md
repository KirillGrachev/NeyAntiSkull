**NeyAntiSkull** is a lightweight, high-performance plugin for Minecraft servers running on Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, and compatible platforms starting from version 1.13. Its primary purpose is to provide full control over player placement of other players' heads (by name) and standard "bare" heads (Steve/Zombie/Creeper). Ideal for servers where order, world cleanliness, and efficient moderation are important.

**Use Cases:**
- Prevent skull spam in cities, on walls, and inside builds.
- Stop unauthorized decoration.
- Reduce moderator workload — no more need to clean the world after restarts.
- Maintain atmosphere on vanilla, Rustic, and RP servers.

**⚡ Features**
- High Performance: The plugin is optimized for operation under heavy load. Tested on servers with active player bases.
- Easy Setup: No complex GUI. Everything is configured via `config.yml`.
- Flexible: Allow head placement only for moderators or VIP players.
- No Dependencies: Works standalone, does not require Vault, ProtocolLib, etc.
